Metals in Urban Streams Tool (MUST) 

MUST estimates concentrations of dissolved copper and zinc in an urban stream based on its catchment land use and stormwater management characteristics. Users are asked to enter details about the proportion of the catchment in each of a number of broad land use classes. One or more generic stormwater source control and treatment options can be selected. By varying inputs, users can re-run the tool to allow comparison of copper and zinc concentration estimates under different scenarios.
